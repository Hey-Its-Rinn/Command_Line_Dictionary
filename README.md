# Command Line Dictionary

This application began as a learning project I ran through on a Udemy course. I developed custom functionality in addition to writing a full suite of unittest to ensure proper code coverage. The application takes advantage of a json library in addition to a number of parsing algorithms. 

## Usage

```python
python command_dicts.py
